## msc thesis code

This is the repository that contains Google Earth Engine JavaScript code for the master thesis entitld "Glacial lake changes from cloud processing of optical satellite images", written at University of Oslo

For mode details and full text see here: https://www.duo.uio.no/handle/10852/88419

// image_count.js - counts available Landsat images for the area of interest 

// image_scale_time_series.js - makes time-series of water area changes, based on image classification (Landsat revisit period (~2weeks) temporal resolution

// annual_caucasus_inventory.js - creates annual composites (1 image with .min() and .max() values per year), applies threshold to classify water and makes a 5-year-averaged glacial lake masks

// time_series_app_sourse.js - is the sourse code for the test/prototype earth engine app
