## msc thesis code

This is the repository that contains Google Earth Engine JavaScript code for the master thesis entitld "Glacial lake changes from cloud processing of optical satellite images"

// image_count.js - counts available Landsat images for the area of interest 

// image_scale_time_series.js - makes time-series of water area changes, based on image classification (Landsat revisit period (~2weeks) temporal resolution

// annual_caucasus_inventory.js - creates annual composites (1 image with .min() and .max() values per year), applies threshold to classify water and makes a 5-year-averaged glacial lake masks

// time_series_app_sourse.js - is the sourse code for the test/prototype earth engine app
